This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

# Project Overview
This document provides an overview of the different tools and frameworks that are integrated into your Next.js project.

## Next.js Application
Next.js is a popular React framework that enables features like server-rendered React applications, static site generation, and API routes. It simplifies the development of React applications by providing a well-defined structure and built-in optimizations.

## LangChain
LangChain is a language model library that has been integrated into your Next.js project. It enables you to use natural language processing features powered by OpenAI's language model.

## tRPC
tRPC is a TypeScript RPC framework that enables type-safe communication between your client and server code. It allows you to define backend procedures (API endpoints) and automatically generates the corresponding client-side functions to call those procedures, ensuring end-to-end type safety.

## GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions have been added to your project to automate tasks like building, testing, and deploying your application. This allows you to ensure your code is always in a working state and to automate deployment to your chosen platform.

## Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to build custom designs quickly and efficiently. It has been integrated into your Next.js project, making it easy to style your application using utility classes.

## Turborepo
Turborepo is a high-performance build system for JavaScript and TypeScript projects. It enables you to optimize and manage builds, tests, and deployments across multiple packages within your project. This ensures faster build times and a more efficient development process.

## Prisma
Prisma is a next-generation ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) for Node.js and TypeScript. It simplifies database access and management by providing a type-safe, auto-generated client that maps to your database schema. This makes it easy to interact with your database while ensuring type safety and reducing boilerplate code.

## Vercel
Vercel is a deployment platform for frontend applications and serverless functions. It offers a seamless integration with Next.js, providing features like automatic SSL, custom domains, and continuous deployment from your Git repository. With Vercel, you can deploy your application globally, ensuring optimal performance and low latency for your users.

## Pinecone
Pinecone is a vector database that enables you to perform similarity search and other vector-related operations efficiently. It is designed for machine learning applications and can be used in various scenarios, such as recommendation systems, natural language processing, and image search.
